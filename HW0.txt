1. Intended platform for final project (e.g. Android, iOS)

  Apple - iOS

2. Intended framework/programming language for your final project (e.g. Kotlin, Swift)

  Swift

3. Whether you want to explore cross-platform development

  No, I want to focus on iOS platform development for now as I am a beginner. 

4. Include a brief explanation for your selections

  1. iOS: I decided to stick to iOS development as it's the platform and environment that I am most familiar with as I have had an apple device ever since I could remember (iPod, iPhone, Macbook, iPad, AirPods, Apple Watch, etc.).
  2. Swift: I've never used swift before but after doing some research I found that swift would be the most appropriate for developing apps for iOS since it's created by apple for the purpose of this.
  3. Cross-platform: It would be cool to be able to develop an app available on multiple platforms but I want to focus on iOS development for now as I've never built a mobile application before.
